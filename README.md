# Drush Make, from Node.js?

Obviously, huge thanks to @rupl for the original idea, all of the front-end, the list of modules, the css.

Actually, everything except for this Node.js code.

## Running this.

You'll need to run this from a location that has access to your `git` binary. The `/modules` route accepts a drupal version in `X.x` format, and then a module name, as it would appear on drupal.org.

* /modules/7.x/views

Each select list is populated with the versions at select time.
